# Highlights
This repository contains highlights of other work that I've done
The addtocart.php, addtocart.js, autocomplete.php, and autocomplete.js files were part of a 2016 project I did for a customer who wanted a completely custom-coded ecommerce website created to interface with a preexisting product database. 

The full project is in the 'ecommerce' repository.

The two screenshots from pgadmin were generated while working on schema design and view creation sections of the Data Engineering certificate course I completed in 2023.
The example-dag file is from the Apache Airflow section of the same course.
